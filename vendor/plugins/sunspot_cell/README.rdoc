= Sunspot Cell

This plugin adds Cell support (for indexing rich documents like pdf, docs, html, etc...) to Sunspot (developed against Sunspot 1.2.1).
Support Paperclip and S3 Storage

The code is based on the patch included here:
http://outoftime.lighthouseapp.com/projects/20339/tickets/98-solr-cell

== Requirements

* Sunspot gem installed

* Solr Cell libraries

* Adjustments to the Solr +schema.xml+

== Install

You can get these from: 

 http://www.chebyte.com/solr-chebyte.tgz

then in the root rails app descompresses this

 #root-app> tar -xvzf solr-chebyte.tgz

note: if you want to put it manually, you have to put jars in solr/lib and schema.xml in solr/conf

  end


== Todo

* Tests

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
